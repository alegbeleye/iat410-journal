                    <p>This week I began working with Unity for the first time
                        in a structured way. I focused on understanding how the
                        editor is organized and how GameObjects and Components
                        work together. I created a simple project, organized
                        ...</p>

                    <p>This week I focused on basic game design principles and
                        how they translate into a playable prototype. I explored
                        the idea of a core gameplay loop and built a small test
                        where the player collects objects and increases

                    <p>This week I began learning Blender to understand the 3D
                        asset pipeline. I practiced navigation, basic modelling,
                        and simple transformations. I created a low poly object
                        and learned how UV unwrapping works so textures
                        can...</p>

                    <div class="meta">February 2, 2026 - 11:45 AM</div>
                    <p>This week I learned how version control supports
                        collaborative development. I set up Git, created a
                        proper ignore file for Unity, and practiced committing
                        changes regularly. I also experimented with branching to
                        isolate ...</p>

                    <p>This week I explored how user interface and visual polish
                        affect the player experience. I built a simple HUD to
                        display score and information clearly. I also
                        experimented with small visual feedback such as
                        particles and ...</p>
