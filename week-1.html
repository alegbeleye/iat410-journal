<h2>Week 1 - Beginning with Unity</h2>
<div class="meta">January 12, 2026 - 09:30 AM</div>
<p>This week I began working with Unity for the first time in a structured way. I focused on understanding how the editor is organized and how GameObjects and Components work together. I created a simple project, organized folders properly, and experimented with adding Sprite Renderers, Colliders, and Rigidbody2D to objects.

One of the most important things I learned was how scripting connects behaviour to objects. I wrote a small movement script using keyboard input and observed how physics affected motion. Seeing a character respond to my code helped me understand how gameplay systems are built from simple interactions.

By the end of the week, I felt more confident navigating Unity and understanding how scenes, prefabs, and scripts relate to each other. This foundation will support future prototyping work.</p>
