<h2>Week 5 - UI, Polish, and Performance</h2>
<div class="meta">February 9, 2026 - 04:20 PM</div>
<p>This week I explored how user interface and visual polish affect the player experience. I built a simple HUD to display score and information clearly. I also experimented with small visual feedback such as particles and camera motion to make interactions feel more responsive.

In addition, I used Unity's profiler to observe performance and learned how draw calls and batching influence rendering efficiency. This introduced me to optimization concepts that are important even in small projects.

Overall, this week showed me that clarity, feedback, and performance all contribute to how a game feels. Small improvements can significantly improve player perception.</p>
