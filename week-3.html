<h2>Week 3 - Introduction to Blender and Assets</h2>
<div class="meta">January 26, 2026 - 02:00 PM</div>
<p>This week I began learning Blender to understand the 3D asset pipeline. I practiced navigation, basic modelling, and simple transformations. I created a low poly object and learned how UV unwrapping works so textures can be applied correctly.

After exporting the model into Unity, I saw how assets move between software and how scale, lighting, and materials influence appearance in the engine. This helped me understand how artists and developers collaborate in production.

Working with Blender also taught me patience and precision. Small modelling decisions can significantly affect the final look and usability of an asset in game development.</p>
