<h2>Week 4 - Version Control and Workflow</h2>
<div class="meta">February 2, 2026 - 11:45 AM</div>
<p>This week I learned how version control supports collaborative development. I set up Git, created a proper ignore file for Unity, and practiced committing changes regularly. I also experimented with branching to isolate features and avoid breaking the main project.

Understanding how merge conflicts occur and how to resolve them gave me insight into real development workflows. Documentation and organization also became more important, especially when working with structured folders and multiple assets.

The key takeaway is that workflow tools are just as important as technical skills. Good project organization reduces mistakes and improves collaboration.</p>
