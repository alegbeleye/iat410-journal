<h2>Week 2 - Learning Game Design Through Prototyping</h2>
<div class="meta">January 19, 2026 - 10:15 AM</div>
<p>This week I focused on basic game design principles and how they translate into a playable prototype. I explored the idea of a core gameplay loop and built a small test where the player collects objects and increases score. Instead of focusing on visuals, I concentrated on interaction, feedback, and pacing.

I experimented with how jump height, gravity, and timing affect the feel of gameplay. Small adjustments created noticeable changes in player control, which showed me how important tuning is in game design. I also learned how early playtesting can reveal issues with clarity and difficulty.

The main lesson from this week is that game design is iterative. Even simple mechanics require testing and adjustment to feel responsive and engaging.</p>
